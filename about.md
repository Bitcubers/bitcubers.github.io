## Shobhit Singh

I am fairly new to cubing. Solved my first 3x3 in early June 2018. 

Attended my [first comp](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/DelhiMonsoonOpen2018) on 22 Jul 2018 but was too much of a pussy to compete after I saw [Shivam Bansal's world record MBLD solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1RKia-I3MI) in that event.

I participated in some un-official comps since then but still haven't competed in a WCA event.

Pretty consertive in the type of events I practise regularly.

Personal Bests:
  
| Event     | Single | Average of 5 |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 3x3x3     |  17.61 |     26.83    |
| 3x3x3 BLD |  58.32 |     DNF :/   |
| 2x2x2     |  7.49  |     11.03    |

Methods :

3x3    : CFOP (Also know Roux but I suck at it)

3x3BLD : Old Pochman 

2x2    : Ortega

Also a programmer and FOSS enthusiast.
