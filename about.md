## Shobhit Singh

I am fairly new to cubing. Solved my first 3x3x3 in early June 2018. 

Attended my [first comp](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/DelhiMonsoonOpen2018) on 22 Jul 2018 but was too much of a pussy to compete after I saw [Shivam Bansal's world record MBLD solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1RKia-I3MI) in that event.

I participated in some un-official comps since then but still haven't competed in a WCA event.

Pretty consertive in the type of events I practise regularly.

Personal Bests:

| Event     | Single | Average of 5 |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| 3x3x3     |  17.61 |     26.83    |
| 3x3x3 BLD |  58.32 |     DNF :/   |
| 2x2x2     |  6..32 49  |     11.03    |

Methods :

3x3    : CFOP (Also know Roux but I suck at it)

3x3BLD : Old Pochman 

2x2    : Ortega

Apart from this I am a hobbyist programmer and FOSS enthusiast.

Hey guys I got interested in cubes about __ years ago and quickly got obsessed with them. Though instead of speedcubing I am more interested in solving different types of puzzles. 

Till now I have tried all puzzles that are in any way part of the official WCA events excluding Skweb and Clock though my times aren't that great.
I have also tried my hands on Kilominx ,Pyramorphix and Mirror cube, Fisher cube, Windmill Cube, Axel Cube, Snake cube in the modding category.

I will be soon reviewing all of them so keep a eye for it :)

Also I am very much interested in hardware and drones. I have even built some by myself!
