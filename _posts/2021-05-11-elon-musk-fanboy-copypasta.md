Idk why cocksucking billionaires get so much fan following but here is why people hate Elon Musk. Writing this all by myself so actually read it if you wanna argue about it. 

He is anti worker unions. He has broken US labour laws many times by trying to sabotage the unionisation efforts in Tesla. There are several court cases going on right against him for this very reason. In February 2017, Musk accused a factory worker who outlined several issues within Tesla in a Medium blogpost of being a “union plant”. In an email, Musk also promised workers free frozen yogurt in a letter to employees that framed unionization efforts as an effort against Tesla by big car companies. The same month, Tesla employee Michael Sanchez alleged he was asked to leave the Tesla factory by security for handing out pro-union flyers outside to fellow employees.

“Tesla pays $17-$21 hourly, Moran said, below the $25.58 an average auto worker earns nationwide. The living wage in Alameda County, which includes Oakland and Fremont, is $28 hourly, he said—and that’s for one adult and one child. “I have two,” he noted. Those wages mean “many co-workers are commuting one or two hours before and after those long shifts because they can’t afford to live closer to the plant.”

I have just pointed out some stories. There are many other stories like this in the sources below. 


He directly and indirectly enables inhuman (read slavery) working conditions in his cobalt mines in Democratic Republic of Congo. Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Dell all got sued over it too but nothing came out of that. This is not to say that only these companies source cobalt from DRC but they are the biggest ones. 

He is pro US imperialism and he himself made this clear with his tweet “We will coup wherever we want” after the US staged a coup against the democratically elected socialist government of Bolivia. This was largely because Bolivia refused to share the lithium mining rights with capitalists like Elon Musk and wanted to process it themselves and then sell it in the international market which did not sit right with US which was denied a cheap source of Lithium. I am not saying that Elon Musk sourced his lithium from Bolivia, I am saying he supported a coup which would enable him to source his lithium from Bolivia. But Evo Morales came in power next year and it was unsuccessful. #vivamorales

This point about emerald mines. There is an interview with his father in which he casually admitted to having owned 50% of an emerald mine and all that. But after that interview with Business Insider, he realised how it painted a bad rep for Elon Musk so they started denying it. For once I am gonna assume that they didn't own a Emerald mine. What changes? Has he still not profited off capitalism? Off racism? He was born in a white family in the most unequal country in the world and got his social and material wealth largely because of his ancestors who stole the land and never gave it back. 
A country where white people earn nearly THREE times the average wage made by black South Africans. How was he not born in wealth again? Obviously this is all considering that very faint chance that he actually did not own an emerald mine for which there is ample proof. 

This is the point which pisses me off most. Elon Musk is not some “inventor”. He is also just like any other capitalist who rakes off billions from the inventions of his unpaid interns. He himself hasn’t invented anything new, rather commodified and capitalised off the inventions of others.
