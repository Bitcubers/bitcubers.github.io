##### Abstract


The restricted access to academic literature has been a topic of debate for the past
three decades. With the advent of the internet and all journals going digital, the
business model and revenues changing, the ethicality of these big publishing houses
have been questioned from time to time. In this paper, I try to analyze the economics,
usefulness, and ethicality of publishing houses and present claims for unrestricted
access to academic literature.


##### Methodology



The primary sources used are studies, research, and news articles which came in the
wake of the Open Access Movement. It also features Aaron Swartz's Guerilla Open
Access Manifesto which was one of the founding works of literature on the modern
iteration of the movement.


##### Introduction


Academic publishing is the subset of the publishing industry which deals with
distributing academic research. The modern era of academic publishing started when
the British government paired Butterworth's (traditional British publisher) with
Springer (German academic publisher) to increase the quality of scientific journals for
being inefficient and broke. From their, Robert Maxwell took over the project in 1951
and turned academic publishing in a money-printing machine. [1]

For a field as niche as this, readers might be surprised that the profit margins of these
publishing houses rival that of tech giants. In 2010, Elsevier’s (old academic publishing
house) scientific publishing arm reported profits of £724m on just over £2bn in
revenue. It was a 36% margin – higher than Apple, Google or Amazon posted that
year. [1] Despite all this, usually a total of $0 is given to the author of the research. The
prices only have increased despite the cost involved in going down with the internet
boom.
This raises a few clear cut questions about the morality of these academic publishing
houses and should they even exist in the first place? This paper explores these
questions and tries to present Open Access as a solution to the problems in the
existing academic publishing system.


##### The dirty economics of Academic Publishing

Today, the majority of academic research is funded with government grants to the
researchers and institutions and if you want to read the research paper that you
funded with your tax paying money, you still need to shell out big bucks. On Elsevier,
accessing just the introduction of a book or a single paper for 24 hours costs $31.50,
purchasing one article from a maths journal from 1982 costs me $55.20 , buying a
subscription to a full journal in India can cost anywhere from $5000 to $40,000[2] and
accessing the whole Elsevier library can cost up to $9M per year [3] with the clear being
the California state university which pays ~$11M for the access. These prices are
pretty much the same among the big players with pay per view costing around $37 on
Taylor and Francis, ~$38.50 on Springer, and $42 on Wiley-Blackwell. Scholars,
academics, and institutions are forced to pay this staggering price if they want to keep


up with a field of research. In 2013, this made the academic publishing industry over
$25Bn with most of the revenue coming from developed places like the US (55%) and
Europe (28%) while Asia which has the majority of student scholars only having 14%
share in the revenue.[4] These aforementioned publishing houses also regularly profit
margins of around 40% per year. To put this in context, the net profit margin of
Facebook is 28.57% [5], Google is 20.71% [6], Apple is 21.35% [7], Amazon is
3.56%[8] and Pfizer (biggest pharma company) is 31.71% [9].

If you take a look at the business models of most non-academic publishing companies,
let’s say the Penguin Random House, they first acquire content, pay the author an
advance for the content, then pay editors for proofreading/finalizing the article and
then pay platforms for distribution and then pay the author royalties for every copy
sold after a certain number of copies. With this model, Penguin Random House or any
typical publishing company makes somewhere around 12-15% of the profit. But in the
case of Academic publishing, the publishing company can avoid the majority of these
investments as they don't have to pay the author ever which means no royalties as
they are already paid by the public grant and the peer review process is done by
scientists on a voluntary basis and is also proven to be a scam many times with
authors peer-reviewing their own papers or getting fake reviews from a circle of
"friends" which make the paper look legitimate.[10] ..
With the paper printed journals back in the day, when you had to transport each print
to the reader there were significant distribution costs, but with the advent of the
internet, the companies can duck all distribution costs as all they have to do is upload
it onto the internet. With no printing cost, and distribution infinitesimally cheap, one
would think that the cost of these papers and journals would have dropped down after
the internet boom but with an effective monopoly over the market lobbying, they have
managed to keep the prices up, even increasing exponentially. A quick look at
numbers shows that the subscription prices have risen by about 145% in the last 6
years. [11]

A 2015 study [12] by the School of Library and Information Sciences of University of
Montreal, showed that in 2013, the top 5 academic publishers, publish more than 50%
papers in every subject with Elsevier, Springer, Wiley-Blackwell and Taylor and Francis
making frequent appearances on the list. This creates virtually no competition in the
market which could have potentially dropped the price down.
This pricing crisis has killed nearly all of the individual subscriptions, so the only way
left to access them are university and public libraries. But with skyrocketing prices,
even big affluent universities like Harvard can’t afford to foot the $3.5M bill put on
their library every year by these large publishers. The only solution is to not subscribe
to a bunch of journals which creates a huge access gap for the patrons of the library
and hinders research. These access gaps are worse in developing or poor nations. In
2008, Harvard subscribed to 98,900 serials and Yale to 73,900. The best-funded
research library in India, at the Indian Institute of Science, subscribed to 10,600.
Several sub-Saharan African university libraries subscribed to zero, offering their
patrons access to no conventional journals except those donated by publishers.[13]
A lot of these publishers also bundle less popular/read journals with the more
popular/read journals so you can't just unsubscribe from these fewer read journals
without
potentially depriving readers of those popular journals. All in all, it is a system
designed to yank as much money as possible from the consumer. Publishing houses
often say point out that they add value in the literature which is true to some extent,
but the author, editor and the funder (public) add much more value than the
publishing house does and two (author and editor) of them don't get paid and another
one (public) has to pay to access it while publisher gets the majority of the cream.



##### What is open access and why open access?

Open access here basically means free unrestricted access to publicly funded
research. This means that researchers post the papers directly on a free database
such as arXiv instead of going through big publishing houses. OA isn’t an attempt to
bypass peer review. Publishing houses generally don’t pay for peer review editors as
most of it is done by dedicated volunteers for their own curiosity and interest, the
editors still have the same incentive when a journal turns OA as they had before. OA
also doesn't reduce the rights of the author over their work. It in fact gives more
freedom to the author as can choose between various Open Access/Open Source
licenses and see which one works best for their interests, all of which have safeguards
against plagiarism and require author attribution. [14]

OA is the part of the solution to many aforementioned problems. It removes the
barriers of entry so that people who can't afford to go to financially affluent institutions
can access this critical literature. In the words of Aaron Swartz, a hacktivist who fought
for OA and gave his life for the movement, “Forcing academics to pay money to read
the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at
Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the
First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.”^
[15]

OA completely solves the pricing crises which has been plaguing the academic world
for decades now but even if we had no pressing issues in our hand, we ideally should
want to take full advantage of the internet for the progress of academic and try to
weed business out of it.
The latest argument for open access came about with the pandemic when researchers
are finding it hard to get access to the millions of paywalled coronavirus related
papers and studies which can potentially help in saving millions of lives.


##### Open access has a greater impact

Studies have shown that open access research has a greater impact on the scientific
community than its proprietary counterparts. Talking about physics, which was one of
the first fields to adopt OA in the form of arxiv.org, In 1991, OA works were only 1% of
the total published works were cited about two times more than that 99 % paid
articles. The percentage of OA works in the field increased to 18% in 2001 when they
cited ~5.5 times more than Non OA works. [16]

In the field of computer science, an analysis of 119,924 articles in 2001 showed that
the mean number of citations to online (free) articles is 7.03 while the mean number
of citations to offline (paid) articles is 7.03. [17]

Kristen Antelman expanded this study to all fields in her paper “ Do Open-Access
Articles Have a Greater Research Impact?" and found that the even though the
percentage of OA papers is only 17% in philosophy, 29% in political science, 37% in
Electronical engineering, the mean citations of OA papers in all these fields is greater
than the mean citations of non OA papers. [18]

![OA-Non OA Citation](/assets/2.png)
OA gives free and easy access to academic literature as it is easily indexed by search
engines like Google and ResearchGate.
The publishing industry also exerts too much influence over what scientists choose to
study. All they need is a steady stream of paper which has a broad audience. They do
not want researchers exploring dead ends and niche topics that are not interesting to
the general public which in the long run are very important to the development of the
field. [19]. This results in headlines like "Eating popcorn increases your confidence" but
the drug trial studies don't get published. [20]



##### Conclusion

Publishing houses that were originally started with the intention of making academia
accessible to scholars and researchers have become the real villains of the industry by
keeping the publicly funded research from the people who funded it. The business
model on which they function has vanished in the past 3 decades but they have
somehow still survived by constant lobbying. We're past time of damage control and
into the era, we are seeing consequences with the inaccessibility of related papers this
pandemic being the latest case. Scholars create knowledge by sacrificing their time,
money, and labor and there is no reason to give its access to multi-billion dollar
corporations. The current system is immoral and inefficient as it has zero interest in
taking advantage of our collective intelligence. It should be our moral imperative to
share the literature with people not privileged enough to afford the humongous costs
associated with it. So to promote science, we should adopt Open Access as a means of
scientific communication.
