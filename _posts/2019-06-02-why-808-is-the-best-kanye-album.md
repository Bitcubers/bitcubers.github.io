Kanye West's *808's And Hearbreaks* is often written off as his one of the weaker projects but what is not considered is the amount of impact 808 had on the hip-hop scene. 

*808's and Heartbreaks* was a melancholic pop-rap album released in 2008 in which Kanye rapped about love and heartbreak. It was one of first type R&B rap albums and laid the foundation for a new wave of hip-hop artists iwho generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection. 

In 2007, Kanye amazed everyone by outselling 50 Cent's generic hood rap album, *Curtis* with his futuristic album, *Graduation*and essentially expanded the subject matter of hip-hop songs. This is exactly what 808's did but on a much larger scale.
It is one of the majot reasons we have famous R&B hip-hop artists like Drake, Frank Ocean, Childish Gambino and Kid Cudi. 

Jake Paine of *HipHopDX* dubbed the album as "our Chronic", noting West's effect on hip hop with 808s & Heartbreak as "a sound, no different than the way Dr. Dre's synthesizer challenged the boom-bap of the early '90s."

It is arguably the most influential we have ever had after the 2000's. It was a experimental album, which was sucessful, Unlike Yeezus.
